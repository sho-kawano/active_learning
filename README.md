# Active Learning
For Stats 227 Project.

A simulation study was conducted to assess three active learning strategies: Random (baseline), Margin, and Entropy Sampling. 
All active learners employed used a Random Forest classifier. 
The study included 60 simulations and the initial labeled data was kept constant throughout.  
Initially 4 observations for each of the 5 categories were labeled. 
The rest were "hidden" and treated as the unlabeled dataset. 

The initial accuracy of a Random Forest classifier was approximately 0.15, 0.36, 0.26, 0.22, and 0.31 (average over 100 different iterations, not included).
